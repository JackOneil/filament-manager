# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [1.23.0] - 2026-03-05
### Added
- **Clear all movement history button**: New red button on the Movement History page allows users to delete the entire movement history at once. Button requires confirmation dialog before proceeding ("Are you absolutely sure you want to delete the ENTIRE movement history? This action cannot be undone.") to prevent accidental data loss.
- Button is positioned next to the per-page selector with trash icon for visual consistency.

## [1.22.0] - 2026-03-05
### Added
- **Fulltext search filters on inventory page**: Brand, Material, and Color filters now support real-time text search (typing instantly narrows options), matching the behavior of the calculator's filament picker. Displays matching options in a dropdown with visual feedback and checkmarks for active selections.
- **Color filter visual enhancement**: Color filter dropdown now shows colored swatches next to each color name for quick visual identification.
- **Low-stock warning indicators**: New visual alerts for filaments:
  - Red "Out of Stock" badge (card view top-right; list view icon) when quantity reaches 0.
  - Orange "Low Stock" badge/icon when remaining weight drops below 20% of total capacity.
  - Applied consistently across both card and list view modes.

### Fixed
- **Critical HTML structure bug in list view**: Fixed missing closing `</div>` for the row wrapper in the list view loop, which caused DOM nesting and catastrophic layout collapse (items appearing on top of each other). This also resolved the modal null error (`Cannot set properties of null`) when interacting with list view items.
- **Alpine reactive flush timing race condition**: Added explicit `classList` synchronization in `fetchContent()` before `innerHTML` insertion, ensuring layout classes are correct immediately when switching between card and list views via AJAX (fixes 3-column grid appearing briefly in list mode after card view).
- **Alpine.js x-cloak visibility flash**: Added missing `[x-cloak] { display: none !important; }` CSS rule in base.html, preventing filter sections from briefly appearing before Alpine.js initializes.

## [1.20.1] - 2026-03-05
### Fixed
- **Reset/Clear filter button is now always visible**: Button no longer disappears when no filters are active. Instead, it displays with a disabled state (grayed out) when no filters are selected, and becomes enabled when filters are applied.
- Button properly toggles between enabled and disabled states via JavaScript when filters are applied or cleared without page reload.

## [1.20.0] - 2026-03-05
### Changed
- **Filtering is now fully interactive (AJAX-based) without page reload**: Brand, Material, and Color filters now update the inventory list instantly as you change selections.
- **Filter apply button is no longer needed** and has been removed. Filters are applied automatically on selection change.
- **Reset/Clear filter button now uses AJAX** instead of page navigation, preserving current sorting and view mode.
- **Filter state is maintained during view mode and sort changes** to provide seamless user experience.

## [1.19.2] - 2026-03-05
### Fixed
- **"Sort by" quick button section is now hidden in list view**: The "Sort by" quick action buttons no longer appear when switching to list view mode, as users can sort directly by clicking on column headers instead.
- Hide/show of sort-by-section is managed via JavaScript visibility toggle when view mode changes.

## [1.19.1] - 2026-03-02
### Fixed
- **List view header now displays translated column names**: Column headers in list view now properly show translated text (e.g., "Název", "Značka", "Kusy") instead of template tags.
- **Sort direction arrows now properly display in AJAX responses**: Arrow icons correctly update when switching views or sorting in list view.
- **Improved internationalization (i18n) for dynamic content**: Created global translation object (`listHeaderLabels`) to ensure proper translations in AJAX-generated content.

## [1.19.0] - 2026-03-04
### Changed
- **View mode toggle (card ↔ list) is now interactive (no page reload)**: Clicking the view toggle buttons now switches between card and list views dynamically via AJAX without reloading the page.
- Converted view toggle links from `<a>` tags to `<button>` elements with `onclick` handlers for AJAX triggering.
- View mode switches instantly while preserving current sort, filters, and page state.

## [1.18.0] - 2026-03-04
### Changed
- **Card view sorting is now interactive (no page reload)**: Clicking sort buttons now updates the card grid dynamically via AJAX without reloading the page.
- Added `/api/filaments-list` support for both card and list view modes — single endpoint handles both views.
- Converted sort button links from `<a>` tags to `<button>` elements with `onclick` handlers for AJAX triggering.
- Card view maintains same interactive experience as list view with smooth updates.

## [1.17.0] - 2026-03-04
### Changed
- **List view sorting is now interactive (no page reload)**: Clicking column headers or using sort buttons now updates the list dynamically via AJAX without reloading the page.
- Added `/api/filaments-list` endpoint for interactive sorting and filtering.
- Converted header links from `<a>` tags to `<button>` elements with `onclick` handlers for AJAX triggering.
### Fixed
- **Mobile list view now properly handles narrow screens**: Sort buttons remain functional on devices where column headers are hidden (`sm:hidden`).
- Improves UX on small screens by maintaining sorting functionality without page navigation.

## [1.16.0] - 2026-03-04
### Added
- Added "Subtract usage" action button to list view with modal dialog for weight input: users can now subtract filament in list view just like in card view.
- Modal dialog displays the selected filament name, accepts weight in grams with min/max constraints matching available weight, and has Cancel/Submit buttons.
- Dark mode styling applied to the modal dialog for consistent appearance.

## [1.15.1] - 2026-03-03
### Changed
- Removed duplicate sort buttons from list view: in list view, users now sort exclusively via clickable column headers (less visual clutter, prevents confusion).
- Sort buttons remain visible in card view where they provide the primary way to sort.

## [1.15.0] - 2026-03-03
### Changed
- Replaced sorting dropdown select with intuitive **quick sort buttons** — users now see all 6 sort options (Name, Brand, Pieces, Remaining, Capacity, Percent) as clickable chips.
- Sorting buttons display directional arrows: **↑** for ascending, **↓** for descending, **↕** for un-sorted options.
- Active sort button is highlighted in blue; inactive buttons are gray and hoverable.
- One-click sorting: no need to open a dropdown first — click the button to apply or toggle direction.
- Dramatically improved UX for both card and list views — sorting is now equally intuitive in both modes.

## [1.14.1] - 2026-03-03
### Changed
- Enhanced list view with clickable column headers: clicking a header toggles sorting direction (ascending ↔︎ descending).
- Column headers now display directional arrows (↑ / ↓) when that column is active.
- Sorting direction preference is fully preserved across pagination, filters, and view mode changes.

## [1.14.0] - 2026-03-03
### Added
- Added sorting feature on the overview page: users can now sort filaments by Name (A-Z), Brand (A-Z), Pieces (most), Remaining weight (most), Total capacity (most), and Percentage (most).
- Sort preference is preserved across pagination and filters.
### Fixed
- Fixed calculator result box visibility in dark theme: "Výsledek Vašeho Výpočtu" heading and result boxes now have appropriate dark mode background colors.

## [1.13.0] - 2026-03-03
### Fixed
- Fixed statistics on the overview page: total spools, remaining weight, and value are now calculated from **all filtered filaments**, not just the current page.
- Fixed missing translation key `'name'` (used in list view header) — added to both `cs` and `en` language dicts.
### Changed
- Replaced all deprecated `Model.query.get(id)` calls with `db.session.get(Model, id)` throughout the codebase.
- Replaced all deprecated `Model.query.get_or_404(id)` calls with `db.get_or_404(Model, id)`.
- Refactored `inject_translations()` context processor to call `get_settings()` once per request instead of issuing three separate DB queries.
- Moved `import math` from inside `use_filament()` function body to the top-level imports.
- Removed unused `session` import from Flask imports.
- Removed legacy `action == 'theme'` handler from the settings route (theme changes are handled exclusively by the `/toggle-theme` endpoint).
- Fixed indentation inconsistency on the `'title'` key in both language dicts in `messages.py`.
- Translated remaining English code comment in add route to Czech.
